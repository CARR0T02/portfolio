Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Gabriel, and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to introduce myself. I am currently a student at NUS studying Computer Science. During my time between NS and University, I started learning Web Development through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I possess a strong eagerness to continue my development and learning as a developer, engaging with new projects and frameworks.

When I'm not busy coding, you can often find me indulging in my love for computer games, strategy games in particular. I also enjoy staying active by playing squash and going for refreshing runs. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
