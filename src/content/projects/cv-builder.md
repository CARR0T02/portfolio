This project acts as an introduction to React. I have practiced using states and props in this project. The states are used to handle inputs which are then used as props to be passed into a component to render. I tried to use Bulma, a CSS Framework.

The CV Application consists of 3 sections, personal information, education and work experience. In each section, you have to fill up the respective inputs to generate a card under each section.

This project is part of The Odin Project, an open source course.
