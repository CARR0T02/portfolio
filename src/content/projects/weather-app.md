The weather app is a project where I practice the use of asynchronous functions and APIs to fetch data.

It fetches the users IP through an API, displaying their current location by default. The app has a search feature to search any city.

_Unfortunately the API changed the free plan to only contain a 3 day forecast_

This project is part of The Odin Project, an open source course.
