This project was built using Astro, Sass and Typescript.

I selected Astro for its content-focused framework, a perfect fit for my portfolio project. Its component islands allow seamless integration of UI libraries if needed. Markdown files hold content with front matter for data, dynamically generating pages during build for my static site hosting.
