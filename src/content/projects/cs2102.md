### Presentation/Communication Skills

<!-- [INSERT GROUP REFLECTION TRY FOR 2/4] -->

Pretty generic fluff mod content, you pick a topic and present on it. 2 groups had really good presentations which stuck to me.

The first presentation was on "Persuasive Communication Strategies". The main idea was that we should gradually move our audience away from their "anchor position" instead of trying to persuade them all at once. I thought this was applicable in many areas of life. For example, when trying to convince your group mates to do something or when trying to convince your boss to reduce your workload during an internship or even your full-time job in the future.

The second group presented on <i>Netiquette</i>, specifically focusing on email structures. The general structure was as follows:

Context &rarr; Body &rarr; Action Items (What needs to be done) &rarr; Recap.

Including headers for each section allows busy reader to skip to the relevant parts. The "Action Items" section was helpful to remind all parties of tasks to be done. I think this structure is too formal for school emails but would be useful in a professional setting.

### Commnipresence

<!-- [INTRO TO COMMNIPRESENCE AND OPINION 1] -->

This concept explores how communication exists in many forms and surrounds us daily. For example, when ordering coffee, multiple forms of communication occurs: talking to the barista, texting on your phone while waiting, thinking to yourself about your order etc.

I think <i>commnipresence</i> is a unique idea and something we often overlook. The scenario given very clearly shows that it comes in many forms. I think this topic did a good job of tying in the CA1 topics. For example:

<ul class="cs2102-ul">
    <li><i>Small talk</i> with the barista.</li>
    <li><i>Netiquette</i> when texting on your phone.</li>
    <li><i>Non-verbal communication</i> through the baristaâ€™s gestures for your order.</li>
</ul>

### User Guide (UG) ðŸ“–

<!-- [Advice to SWE 5] -->

Creating effective user guides is a valuable skill for SWEs as we will need to provide documentation for our software.

Some useful tips provided were:

1. Standardise the layout to save readers time and help them locate information easily.
2. Use hyperlinks to increase navigation.
3. Include a site-wide search function to allow users to quickly find what they need.

This CA3 task was straightforward as we just had to modify our existing UG from CS2103T to suit our target audience.

## Challenges

<!-- [DID NOT ENJOY PRESENTATION... STUTTER/MEMORISATION 3] -->

As an introvert, I dislike presentations. I was constantly nervous and stressed about the upcoming presentations in this mod. Memorising my script was difficult, and I would often stutter during my presentation. However, a presentation given by one of the groups on "Speech Apprehension" provided tips on reducing presentation anxiety which I found useful. I believe that, with practice and exposure, I can improve my presentation skills. I've been making an effort to speak up more in classes and be in charge of group presentations in other mods.

## Conclusion

Overall, a pretty easy mod if you are comfortable with presentations. I definitely learned a lot of applicable skills which can be used in a professional setting. As an aspiring SWE, I think it is valuable to learn how to adjust the technical level in your speech to cater to different audiences and how to communicate effectively with team members. I would recommend this mod to other SWE students and CS students as it is a good break from the technical mods and you get to learn some soft skills which are important in the workplace.
